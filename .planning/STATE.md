## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Deploy skeleton first: Avoid deployment surprises when codebase is complex (affects Phase 1 priority)
- Prompt in codebase file: User has existing tested prompt, keeps it version controlled (affects Phase 3 implementation)
- Require Spotify auth upfront: Need playlist access for familiar tracks feature (affects Phase 2 architecture)
- 9 tracks per artist (3+3+3): Balance between familiar, discovery, and likely-to-be-played-live (affects Phase 4 track selection)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations:**
- Anthropic Tier 2 setup required early ($40 deposit for 1,000 RPM) to avoid rate limits during Phase 3 testing
- Spotify Development Mode limited to 25 users maximum - verify friend group size acceptable before proceeding
- Azure Key Vault permission propagation can take 15-30 minutes - plan setup timing accordingly

**Phase 3 considerations:**
- Claude Vision accuracy with artistic festival typography is unvalidated - may need prompt engineering iteration
- User has pre-built prompt file that needs integration into codebase structure
